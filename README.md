## Hi there :wave:
Sarah here. I'm a software engineer, interested in everything but my speciality is web applications. Also working as instructor at [Clarusway](https://clarusway.com/) and as software engineer at [SOMEWHERE ELSE](https://somewhere.com/)

### What I'm use? ðŸ›   
I prefer React & React Native for web/mobile front-end, Django technologies for back-end development but I love everything about JS and Python!
<br/> 
You may find some experimental and forked projects on my repos, feel free to contribute or using them.
Knowledge should spread! :muscle:
